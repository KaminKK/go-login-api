# Go Login API

This is a simple Go API for user registration and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The API allows users to register new accounts, login with their credentials, and receive JWT tokens for authentication.

## Features

- User registration: Allows users to create new accounts with a unique username, password, first name, and last name.
- User login: Allows users to authenticate using their username and password and receive a JWT token for authorization.
- JWT authentication: Protects API endpoints by requiring clients to provide a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
